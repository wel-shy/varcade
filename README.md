## Description 📝

### Use Case 👵
During a group activity in a care home, residents will enter the environment using Google Cardboard headsets, and be
able to see one another in the environment. Someone, likely the facilitator of the activity will pull a leaver on the
slot machine, showing a random task. Users will then collaborate to complete the task.
